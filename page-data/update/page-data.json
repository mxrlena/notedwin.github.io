I intend for this website to be the last personal website I ever create, and the first one I never finish.</p>\n<p>My aim is to use this website as a platform for growth and to keep it up-to-date with my thoughts and progress (and also to showcase any design work that I'm particularly proud of). Most importantly though, I want it to still be live and available online for years and years to come. The look and feel of the site will likely change and evolve as time goes by but all that will happen with these blog posts remaining the same.</p>\n<p>Of course, the content of these journal entries will have to be of a certain standard.I don't want to just put out content for the sake of putting out content. Some blog posts will be guides for things that I learn so i can use it in the future. Some posts with just be general life updates. Whatever they are the will be quality.</p>\n<p>Through my own learning over the years, I've come to agree with an idea called the Learning Pyramid. The idea outlines retention rates that can be expected with different learning processes, with passive learning (such as attending lectures) being less memorable than say, attending a discussion group and debating an idea.</p>\n<p>Documenting my own learning here in this journal will serve dual purposes; it'll optimise my own growth and provide the best possible rates of retention, and later on, serve as a list of credentials. Not to mention helping others who're trying to learn the same skills.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"tldr\"><a href=\"#tldr\" aria-label=\"tldr permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TLDR;</h3>\n<p>I've had personal website over the years, but none of them are still live. This time I aim to build one that will last. One that will change and evolve over the years, but will still be the same website.</p>\n<p>I aim for this to be the last personal website I build.</p>\n<p>Primarily, I'd like to use my site for myself. Using the blog entries to document my learning and, in doing so, learn faster and retain more.</p>\n<p>If other people can benefit from those blog entries and the guides I write, that would be great. But first and foremost, it will be a for my own improvement. That's the goal.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"owo-uwu-nuzzles-u\"><a href=\"#owo-uwu-nuzzles-u\" aria-label=\"owo uwu nuzzles u permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>\"owo uwu nuzzles u\"</h4>\n<p><em>Albert Einstein</em></p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Howdy There has been many versions of my personal website.
