Of course, there are websites like \"WayBackMachine\" that offer a glimpse into the past, but unless the content owner takes steps to provide an archive (or the content proves popular enough to warrant duplication and proliferation) then it's all too common for information, design, code, content, to disappear forever.</p>\n<p>For example: Over the years I've had several personal websites, but none of them are still live. I stopped designing and coding new material for each one long before I allowed the hosting to lapse. Eventually I even let the domains go, until the only evidence they ever even existed are folders of code and dusty design files on my own local archived hard drives.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-intend-for-this-website-to-be-the-last-personal-website-i-ever-create-and-the-first-one-i-never-finish\"><a href=\"#i-intend-for-this-website-to-be-the-last-personal-website-i-ever-create-and-the-first-one-i-never-finish\" aria-label=\"i intend for this website to be the last personal website i ever create and the first one i never finish permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I intend for this website to be the last personal website I ever create, and the first one I never finish.</h3>\n<p>This is a declaration of intent. My aim is to use this website as a platform for growth and to keep it up-to-date with my thoughts and progress (and also to showcase any design work that I'm particularly proud of). Most importantly though, I want it to still be live and available online for years and years to come. The look and feel of the site will likely change and evolve as time goes by, but I like the idea of my older journal posts still being public when the year 2019 seems a distant memory.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"tldr\"><a href=\"#tldr\" aria-label=\"tldr permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TLDR;</h3>\n<h2 id=\"ive-had-personal-website-over-the-years-but-none-of-them-are-still-live-this-time-i-aim-to-build-one-that-will-last\"><a href=\"#ive-had-personal-website-over-the-years-but-none-of-them-are-still-live-this-time-i-aim-to-build-one-that-will-last\" aria-label=\"ive had personal website over the years but none of them are still live this time i aim to build one that will last permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I've had personal website over the years, but none of them are still live.
